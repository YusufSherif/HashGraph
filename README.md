# HashGraph
An optimized generic Graph Container
<br>
This graph utilizes unordered_maps to store vertices with its key in an unordered_map as well as storing edges in
 another unordered_map with a key pair denoting the vertices of the edges as the key.

  For proper use, a user may inherit both the edge and vertex classes into his own link and node classes and use 
  the graph functions seamlessly.
